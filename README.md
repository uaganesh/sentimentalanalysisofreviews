A system that gives customers with a verified score of any online product derived using the
Sentiment Analysis NLP technology. The system looks through the text for keywords that convey
specific emotions. Natural Language Processing was utilised to create a fine-grained Sentimental
Analysis report. This classifier assists us in categorising reviews gathered from the product’s
website URL into specified categories, confirming the user’s thinking process and generating a
rating from 1 to 5 (1 being the lowest, 5 being the highest).This approach is used by the system
to collect all of the reviews and transform the textual meaning into a sensible average grade. Fake
reviews posted by sellers to boost their product is also filtered during the grading process. This
procedure allows any potential consumer to get a clear judgement about the purchase decision
